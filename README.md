# Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')

This repository contains a JavaScript code example that demonstrates an error that can occur when using the length property of an object that may be undefined.

The error is handled in the `bugSolution.js` file, preventing the code from throwing an error and handling the undefined case gracefully.

## Bug

The original code has a potential bug. If the input `x` is `undefined`, accessing `x.length` will throw a `TypeError`. This is because `undefined` does not have a `length` property.

## Solution

The improved code checks for both `null` and `undefined` inputs.  If `x` is either `null` or `undefined`, it returns 0. Otherwise, it accesses the `length` property as before. This method avoids the error by explicitly handling the cases where the object might not have the property.
